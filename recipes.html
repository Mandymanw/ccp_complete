                <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare the Avocados: Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl. Use a fork to mash the avocados to your desired level of smoothness. Some prefer it chunky, while others like it creamy.</li>
                    <li>Add the Lime Juice: Squeeze the juice of two limes over the mashed avocados. The lime not only adds a zesty flavor but also helps prevent the guacamole from browning.</li>
                    <li>Combine the Ingredients: Add the diced red onion, tomatoes, jalapeño peppers, minced garlic, and chopped cilantro to the mashed avocados. These ingredients provide a balance of textures and flavors.</li>
                    <li>Season to Taste: Season the guacamole with salt and pepper, adjusting the amounts to suit your preferences. Keep in mind that you can always add more, so start with a little and taste as you go.</li>
                    <li>Mix Thoroughly: Gently fold all the ingredients together until they are well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as you want to maintain some texture in the guacamole.</li>
                    <li>Taste and Adjust: Give the guacamole a taste test. If you feel it needs more acidity, you can add extra lime juice. If it's not spicy enough, you can add more jalapeño or a pinch of cayenne pepper.</li>
                </ol>
